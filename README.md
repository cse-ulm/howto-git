## Introduction
Git is a powerful tool for managing and tracking changes in your code. It allows you to collaborate with others and easily revert to previous versions of your code if necessary. In this tutorial, we will cover the most important Git commands and workflows, so you can start using Git in your own projects.

## Setting up Git

Before you can start using Git, you need to install it on your computer and configure it with your name and email address. Here's how to do it:

### Installing Git
If you don't already have Git installed on your computer, you can [download](https://git-scm.com/downloads) it from the Git website. Follow the instructions for your operating system to install Git.

### Configuring Git
Once you have Git installed, you need to configure it with your name and email address. Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following commands, replacing "Your Name" and "you@example.com" with your own information:

```
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email you@example.com
```
These commands will set your name and email address as the default identity for all of your Git commits. You only need to run these commands once, and Git will remember your settings.

That's it! You're now ready to start using Git.
